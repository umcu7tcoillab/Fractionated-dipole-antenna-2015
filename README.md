# Fractionated dipole antenna (2015)

## About us
This design has been made by the coil-lab and Alexander Raaijmakers of the High Field MRI Group of the UMC Utrecht in the Netherlands. We are part of a research group which means we feel the need to publicise some of our designs to whomever can make use of it, to further the research of MRI applications.


## The design
As publicised by Raaijmakers et al. The fractionated dipole antenna: A new antenna for body imaging at 7 Tesla. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine; 2015. This dipole is the same as the one used as in the mentioned paper. 

The PCB has been drawn in Kicad 5.1.4.
